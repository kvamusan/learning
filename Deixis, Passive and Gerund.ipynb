      "['Women privileged\\n\\nby social status were separated from public discourse and sequestered in their home as the proper\\n\\nplace for women and children by sentiments of protected isolation.', 'Social ideas about women\\n\\nwere dictated by literature, sentiment, and the authority and praxis of medical professionals who\\n\\neagerly proffered opinions on the nature, cause, and cure of women’s nervous conditions.', 'In the West,\\n\\nthe medical profession was populated with “enlightened” male physicians who opined on the\\n\\norigin of neurasthenia in women.', 'Many medical practitioners advised against any intellectual activity for women\\n\\nwho complained of nervous disorders and, instead, prescribed quiet and bedrest.', 'Gilman’s\\n\\nresponse to her physician’s prescriptive isolation was to write a protest framed by her short story\\n\\n“The Yellow Wallpaper” to comment on what she saw as the inequitable treatment of women\\n\\nliving under socially constructed definitions of gender that kept women at home.', 'The short story\\n\\nreceived the critical attention of women who, like the author, were resentful of a destiny imposed\\n\\nby biology and by medical practitioners who felt threatened by its explicit honesty.', '6\\n\\x0c       Gilman’s story takes place in an isolated colonial mansion where the heroine is enclosed\\n\\nand kept under strict scrutiny by her physician/husband who forbids her to write or engage any\\n\\nintellectual activity; frustrated and denied any creative outlet, she projects her resistance and\\n\\npersona onto the forms she perceives in the yellow wallpaper lining the dormant nursery room\\n\\nupstairs in the old house that her husband, against her will, decided they would use.', 'In this thesis,\\n\\nI analyze the linguistic features of metaphor, metonymy, and narrative gap to show how Gilman\\n\\nrepresents social structures as physical structures of confinement that are experienced by women\\n\\nsuch as the protagonist in her story and how such enclosures extrapolate to include all women.', 'I argue that Gilman imbues her narrative with metaphorical references that carry feminist\\n\\nimplications of resistance to the male authority represented in her story and, more, as a political\\n\\ncommentary on the social institutions that impede women’s progress into the expressly public\\n\\ndomain beyond their domestic enclosure.', 'The goal of this thesis is to illuminate the corresponding connections between social institutions\\n\\nof marriage and domesticity and the physical structures portrayed by Gilman.', 'In 1892, Gilman’s\\n\\nwork was published in the New England Magazine where it met with disdain by literary critics\\n\\nand earned rebuke from one physician who, in a letter to the editor of The Boston Evening\\n\\nTranscript, wrote: “It is graphically told in a somewhat sensational style .', 'holding the reader in\\n\\nmorbid fascination, it certainly seems open to serious question if such literature should be\\n\\npermitted in print” (8 April 1892).', '(271)\\n\\nFollowing a long career as a writer and a tumultuous life underscored by hardship and poverty,\\n\\nGilman finally met with success as a feminist intellectual who lectured for women’s rights and\\n\\nsuffragist causes.', 'In later years, Gilman’s story\\n\\nreceived as much, if not more, attention from feminists as when she wrote it.', 'Within the literary canon of women’s writing, Gilman’s text has been reviewed by a\\n\\ndiverse audience of readers with opposing political agendas alternately claiming her work as\\n\\nfeminist, divergent, and/or psychologically revealing.', '8\\n\\x0c       Returning to a feminist agenda, Thomas Erskine and Connie Richards (1993) comment\\n\\non the “critical interest” in Gilman’s text by the feminist press, noting connections between the\\n\\nprotagonist’s descent into madness and the author’s analysis of her own breakdown represent\\n\\n“every woman’s plight in a culture defined by patriarchal condescension” (9).', 'Annette Kolodny (1980) notes a generational carryover of literary influence among writers who\\n\\nare included in a shared canon of literary heritage, a literary discrimination that leads her to ask\\n\\nwhat happens when readers and writers find themselves “cut off and alien from that dominant\\n\\ntradition” (453).', 'Similarly, Judith Fetterley (1986) takes issue with the entrapment of women in\\n\\ntext-worlds written by men in which they are denied self-recognition and agency.', 'Fetterley notes\\n\\nsilencing the female other in male textuality precipitates a crisis of identity for women who see\\n\\nthemselves imaged in such texts and contends the reason why women are subsumed and made\\n\\nsilent is the anxiety over loss of power and control (182).', 'Fetterley argues that women become\\n\\ncharacters in masculine texts that bear no relation to reality and, in losing the power to define\\n\\nthemselves, “are forced to deny their own reality” (183).', 'Patrocinio Schweikart and Elizabeth\\n\\nFlynn (1986) review the issue, writing, “For men, reading women’s stories means confronting\\n\\nthemselves reflected in the eyes of women—they must endure the gaze of the other” (xix).', '9\\n\\x0c         Internecine conflict among feminist critics in their approach to, and critique of, literary\\n\\ntexts has led to the reevaluation of prioritized agendas pursued by feminist scholars between\\n\\n1970-1980.', 'In accord with Dock, my analysis follows using text emphasized in the original version.', 'The literary review of Gilman’s text in this qualitative analysis will be aided by exploring her use\\n\\nof linguistic features such as metaphor, metonymy, and narrative gap to offer new interpretations\\n\\nof her work.', 'For instance, Kövecses uses the example LIFE\\n\\nIS A JOURNEY 1    to illustrate “coherently organized knowledge about journeys” that is relied on to\\n\\nunderstand the more abstract concept of life (4).', 'As well, two other theories are applied to the analysis of Gilman’s text:\\n\\nHypothetical World Theory for its contribution to how fictional worlds are formed and Feminist\\n\\nTheory for Gilman’s affiliation with the women’s activist movement and the way in which the\\n\\nnuances in the text incline toward that focus.', 'Hypothetical World Theory (HWT) is presented by\\n\\nMarie-Laure Ryan and Alice Bell (2019), who propose fictional worlds as alternative realities in\\n\\nwhich “things could be different from what they are” (3) and as possible alternatives in a many\\n\\nworld’s ontology.', 'For this thesis, I propose to focus on a liberal\\n\\nperspective represented by leading feminist scholars in the field of literary studies.', 'CFLT aids in comprehending why the protagonist merges\\n\\nher identity with the phantoms fleeing the house and when incorporated into the textual analysis\\n\\nof Gilman’s script provides a fuller review and theoretical grounding for assumptions authorizing\\n\\nhow the text is received and interpreted for this study.', 'As a\\n\\nlinguistic feature, metaphors are used in writing to suggest what is not directly addressed by the\\n\\nauthor by using corresponding attributes.', 'Megan Henricks Stotts (2021) argues metaphors can be\\n\\n“recognized as indirect speech acts [and as] indirect directives that invite the hearer to engage in\\n\\nopen-ended comparison” and as a “pragmatic phenomenon” that does “something fundamentally\\n\\ndifferent” in the way it conveys information by emphasizing “what a speaker means .', 'H. D. Adamson (2019) explains metaphor as a comparison “asking us to view one\\n\\n[concept] in terms of the other” so that “metaphors provide a mapping across two concepts, one\\n\\nof which contains features that are mapped onto corresponding features in the other concept”\\n\\n(54).', 'David Ritchie (2013) argues metaphors work by “focusing on the attributes of the vehicle\\n\\nthat are transferred to the topic” noting many attributes are “culturally associated with the\\n\\nvehicle” (28).', 'Kövecses\\n\\ndistinguishes between conceptual metaphor, defined as mentioned, and linguistic expression,\\n\\n\\n\\n                                                 13\\n\\x0cwith the latter as one of context and concrete reference with words that “come from the language\\n\\nor terminology of the more concrete conceptual domain” (4).', 'The intentionality\\n\\nbehind a speaker’s utterance defines how metaphors work to convey a writer’s or speaker’s\\n\\nmeaning by alluding to something not directly addressed, as mentioned by Stotts.', 'Searle (1979) posits intentionality as key to understanding metaphor\\n\\nand as an indirect speech act performed by the speaker to “communicate to the hearer more than\\n\\nhe actually says by way of relying on their mutually shared background information .', 'Kent Bach and Robert\\n\\nHarnish (1979) concur, offering extended explanation of indirect illocutionary acts as based on a\\n\\nsystem of “mutual contextual beliefs” shared between people of “that which is said, that which is\\n\\ndone, and the intended relation between them” (66).', 'By showing\\n\\nthat these domains [theories] and [buildings] are actually related via two cognitive links which\\n\\ndo arise from experiential correlations we save an important generalization” (287).', 'The\\n\\n“generalization” mentioned by Grady regards cognitive integration of “submappings” derived\\n\\nfrom individual experiential motivation (287).', 'Grady proposes a “systematic” interdependence of\\n\\nparts that compose separate domains as an organized form of association motivated by\\n\\nexperience (285).', 'In other words, stored experience organizes association of characteristics\\n\\nrecognized in separate domains and fosters cognitive integration.', 'The emphasis on experiential correlation in Grady’s article indicates the importance of\\n\\nunderstanding metaphor through “mutual contextual beliefs” introduced by Bach and Harnish.', 'Human cognition\\n\\nis structured around scripts: knowledge stores containing information about familiar types of\\n\\nevents and situations” (2-3).', '15\\n\\x0c       Gavin’s explores how metaphor fits within Text World Theory in terms that are\\n\\nreminiscent of the theory proposed by Gilles Fauconnier and Mark Turner (2001).', 'has been of enormous benefit to Text World Theory,” positing a “close\\n\\nrelationship with contemporary theories” (148).', 'Metonymy\\n\\n       Similar to metaphor, metonymy relies on cognitive function to integrate concepts into an\\n\\nanalogical whole that relates a singular part to the encompassing whole represented by the part.', 'George Lakoff and Mark Johnson (1980) describe metonymy as “using one entity to refer to\\n\\nanother that is related to it” and synecdoche as “where the part stands for the whole” (35-36).', '16\\n\\x0c       Lakoff (1987) proposes an extraordinary theory of Idealized Cognitive Models (ICM)\\n\\nthat structure a mental space as described by Fauconnier where one concept expands to provide\\n\\nrelationship between two related parts (68).', 'H. D. Adamson (2019) describes a variation of metonymy called\\n\\nsynecdoche that forms a “particular kind of conceptual metonymy often found in literature” (79).', 'Adamson notes\\n\\nsynecdoche can also reverse the representational process to where the whole is represented by a\\n\\nspecific part, as in the example, “the university has enacted a hiring freeze,” where university\\n\\nrepresents the administration of the university (79).', 'The idea that one conceptual\\n\\ndomain offers “new elements” is explored by Sandra Handl and Hans-Jörg Schmid (2011), who\\n\\ndiscuss the conventionality of metonymies.', 'Handl and Schmid emphasize ways of “figurative\\n\\nthinking are so entrenched speakers are no longer aware of it” complemented by “the cognitive\\n\\nsalience of attributes involved in the metonymical construal (85-86).', 'In their emphasis on conventionality, Handl and Schmid note, “A conceptual metonymy\\n\\nshould be considered conventional if it is shared by the members of a speech community” and\\n\\n\\n\\n                                                17\\n\\x0cbears on “well-established ways of thinking” (88).', 'In his introduction, Bernaerts argues narrative gaps\\n\\nfollow from what he terms a “cognitivist approach” that focuses on the “mental operations\\n\\nrequired to comprehend narratives” (8).', 'However, for brevity, this paper will focus solely on cognitive approaches to textual gaps\\n\\nfound in studies such as those by Richard Gerrig (2010).', 'The contrast in the respective theories of Gerrig and Gavin lies in how readers use\\n\\nmemory, experience, and schemas to encode inferences “supported by information that is readily\\n\\navailable from each reader’s memory” (22).', 'While the memory-based approach allows readers to\\n\\nbe more fluid and selective in determining which samples of memory are used, the approach of\\n\\nencoded schemas argued by Gavins tends to limit or restrict how readers react and interpret text.', 'Abbott refers to textual gaps as a “guided\\n\\nprocess in which we are not only cued to fill gaps in a certain way but also cued to leave other\\n\\ngaps unfilled” (109).', 'Iser wrote narrative\\n\\ngaps were essential components of any text and, further, no text could be known in its entirety\\n\\n(40).', '19\\n\\x0c       Iser argued “A literary text must therefore be conceived in such a way [that] it will\\n\\nengage the readers’ imagination in the task of working things out for himself” (275).', 'Meir\\n\\nSternberg (1978) concurs, writing, “every literary work opens a number of gaps that have to be\\n\\nfilled in by the reader” (50).', 'The “contractual\\n\\nagreement” noted by Abbott reflects Gilman’s dependence on the cooperation of readers to infer\\n\\nmeaning from gaps of unfilled narrative left deliberately open.', 'An example of this is found in\\n\\nthe text when the narrator confesses, “John does not know how much I really suffer.',

and Bell hypothesize\\n\\nfictional worlds where it is possible to distinguish truth to facilitate possibilities of an alethic\\n\\nsystem, noting not only could things be different from what they are in reality but that things\\n\\n“could be different in many different ways,” and propose that readers are enabled in a many-\\n\\nworlds ontology to evaluate statements as either true or false by being given the option of more\\n\\nthan one possible world and outcome (3).', 'Ryan posits an explicit difference between fictional worlds limited by relationship to the\\n\\ntext and storyworlds

into the margins of oblivion aided by a hysterical heroine who remains imprisoned behind\\n\\nthe barred windows of the nursery room itself held captive by the yellow wallpaper.', 'Hysteria, when reviewed through feminist ideology, reconfigures itself as a feminine\\n\\nresource predicating on established ideas about women as weak and susceptible and provides\\n\\nwomen with a medically authenticated excuse to escape.', 'The feminist perspective of hysteria is\\n\\nfractured, at once prescriptive and performative, and when read through the feminist lens it\\n\\nbecomes a condemnation and a resource of survival.', 'It is this contradictory nature of hysteria that\\n\\nwhile considered by the DSM-III to be a “feminine characteristic” can also affect men.', 'Feminist\\n\\nperspective does not exclude the consideration of men in its calculus of equity and when applied\\n\\nto Gilman’s fiction can be used to review the role of the stalwart, rational physician assigned to\\n\\nJohn as equally susceptible to hysteria.', 'If the theory of hypothetical worlds and alternate\\n\\npossibilities can be trusted to interpret or provide other explanations for what occurs within\\n\\nfictional worlds such as Gilman’s, then it is possible to suggest that John, too, is affected by the\\n\\n\\n\\n                                                   37\\n\\x0cpervasive influence of the yellow wallpaper.', '(36)\\n\\nThe incidence of male hysteria was discussed and documented by leading medical practitioners\\n\\nin Europe and England throughout the nineteenth century.', 'Sigmund Freud (1886) presented a\\n\\npaper on male hysteria before the Viennese Society of Physicians that was built on the work and\\n\\nestablished theories of Jean-Martin Charcot’s (1877) Leçons sur les Maladies du Système\\n\\nNerveux, Paul Briquet’s (1859) Traité clinique et thérapeutique de l’Hystérie, and Moritz\\n\\nBenedikt’s (1868) Elekteotherapie.', 'Henri Ellenberger (1970) delves\\n\\ninto the history of male hysteria, writing, “since many accident victims were men, the diagnosis\\n\\nof male hysteria, formerly restricted to men with classical symptoms, was now extended to men\\n\\nwith functional, posttraumatic disorders.', 'Feminist logic would assume any medically recognized disorder such as hysteria, when\\n\\nshared equally across gender, would alleviate the stigmatization associated with it, thereby\\n\\nremoving its “feminine characteristic” from review.', 'The disadvantages of\\n\\nthis are apparent in the domestic inhibitions recognized by the protagonist as a means of control,\\n\\nas when Gilman writes, “I get unreasonably angry with John sometimes.', 'While such interpretations rely on the use of a feminist ideology, the literary\\n\\nmetaphors do incline toward perceiving the heroine as a woman trapped by the conventions and\\n\\nexpectations of conforming behavior society imposes.', 'Metaphor relies on overlap, extension, and\\n\\ngrouping of characteristics recognized in correspondents represented in conceptual domains; the\\n\\nidea that “correspondents” must be recognized and identified successfully suggests possibility of\\n\\na breach where the metaphor fails to perform as anticipated.', 'The example used by Kövecses,\\n\\n“LIFE IS A JOURNEY,” therefore, relies on the cultural understanding of life as a journey taken.', 'The\\n\\nconceptual metaphor here expresses the idea of the wallpaper as animated and, while different\\n\\ninterpretations can be formed according to the readers’ own subjective experience, conception of\\n\\nrestraint is explicitly perceived by the protagonist as a willful entity that restrains the figures\\n\\nwithin its grasp.', '40\\n\\x0cThe wallpaper then is conceived of as a material force of opposition corresponding to structured\\n\\nenclosures as a form of restraint used against women.', 'The Yellow Wallpaper is an Animate Force of Opposition\\nSource: Yellow Wallpaper                     Target: Animated Entity\\n\\nDesign and Pattern                           Animus/Influence\\n\\nFaded Paper

patterns as a palpable form\\nof restraint that maps onto the concept of a prison with similar sensorial sensations and function.', 'The longing expressed by the protagonist to get away from her current situation is rebuked by the\\n\\nauthority of her husband who declines to allow her to leave.', 'A third\\n\\nmetaphor lies in the way the character of John is written as a dominant authority in the home and\\n\\nrepresentative of the social institutions that support his authority and from which he derives his\\n\\nstatus.', 'Authority is represented in physical form as\\n\\nJohn, and conceptually, in the formal institutions that exert control over lesser men and women\\n\\nby demonstrating how the correspondent of control is present in each domain.', 'Control is evidenced in John’s presumption to\\n\\nmake unilateral decisions concerning his wife, “John says that if I don’t pick up faster he shall\\n\\nsend me to Weir Mitchell in the fall” (33).', '43\\n\\x0c       The metaphor of control works because representation of resistance configured in the\\n\\nwoman maps onto ideas of resistance configured in the opposition to social institutions that\\n\\ndemand compliance.', 'The corresponding element recognized in Gilman’s fiction as resistance can be\\n\\nmapped onto the resistance of the women’s social movement in its bid for recognition and\\n\\nequity.', 'The woman/victim/heroine written into Gilman’s fiction corresponds in kind with the\\n\\nsocial movement of feminist resistance to the institutionalized authority of white men.', '44\\n\\x0c       In the case quoted, the wallpaper, as the source domain, maps the visual element of color\\n\\nas odor onto the more abstract target domain of intangible sensations where both are connected\\n\\nby extension of associated characteristics.', 'Adamson explains a second aspect of metaphor he terms elaboration that works by\\n\\n“expanding on and supplying details about an aspect of a source domain that is commonly\\n\\nmapped onto a target domain,” (76).', 'The\\n\\nelaborated metaphor of the wallpaper sticking to the wall and that of brothers sticking together\\n\\nworks by sharing a common element of attachment as an associated characteristic that exists both\\n\\nin the wallpaper and in the domain of siblings.', 'Metonymy can be thought of as an inductive process that reasons from one example of reference\\n\\nto implicate the entire concept, such as when Gilman images John as indicative of male\\n\\nauthority.', 'John’s role and character in the story can be contextualized both as metaphorical, in that he\\n\\nis written as representative of social institutions that politically, and systemically diminish\\n\\nwomen’s authority, and as metonymic of the presumed authority imbued to white men.', 'In the second example, Gilman writes\\n\\nfeminine forms into the wallpaper that desperately seek to find a way out from their prison, a\\n\\nprison the heroine contrives from the pattern imprinted on the wallpaper.', '46\\n\\x0c       The same gothic reference extends to the “colonial mansion” mentioned in the text as the\\n\\ntype of home that invites gracious living with extended gardens and walkways.', 'The final example of\\n\\nmetonymy occurs with the characterization of the protagonist as a woman driven to insanity by\\n\\nthe combined opposition of her husband and the institutions that supported his authority over her.', 'John’s role as a member of\\n\\nthat elite class who commands authority contrasts vividly with the role written for the heroine,\\n\\nwho typifies the quiet reservation of domestic women who lived quietly in the shadow of their\\n\\nhusbands.', 'The submission experienced by the heroine in the story can be extended to represent\\n\\nthe experience of other women who had demands placed upon them in the marital relationship.', 'Narrative gap is a literary device writers use to their advantage and Gilman’s use of it\\n\\nallows readers to hypothesize what could have happened in her story when she fails to disclose\\n\\nthat information.', 'In the next paragraph, Gilman\\n\\nwrites, “Well the Fourth of July is over!” Again, something has occurred in the interval but left\\n\\nuntold, leaving the reader to fill in the missing narrative (18).', 'The reader is left to\\n\\ninfer from what has been written that it is the protagonist who sees herself as trapped, but the\\n\\nnarrative fails to make this hypothesis clear or to confirm it and, instead, requires the reader to\\n\\nresolve the absence of information.', 'While this\\n\\nis the first mention of “Jane,” it can be inferred from the text that she is the narrator of the story,\\n\\nand she has dissociated from herself by merging her identity with the anonymous women who\\n\\nare exiting the wallpaper.', 'It is possible that “Jane,” as an anxious and submissive wife, may have\\n\\nbeen a threat to the new identity assumed by the protagonist and opposed her quest to escape.', 'The textual omissions present spaces where readers are invited to construct the story and\\n\\napply their own hypothesized endings grounded in interconnected networks of experience.', 'Gilman’s decision to abrogate her text at critical junctures of revelation\\n\\ncombines with the indeterminate nature of the text to pose difficult questions of interpretation for\\n\\nreaders, who are, as Iser notes, “driven by the urge to group things together and unravel the\\n\\ntangle, but any attempt to do so reflects [their] own personal preferences rather than any\\n\\nsupposed objective meaning” (111).', 'SUMMARY\\n\\n       The text used in this analysis follows the version most closely confirmed as Gilman’s\\n\\noriginal writing and, therefore, contains her exclamation marks, abbreviated sentence structure\\n\\nand, most importantly, the way in which Gilman structures her abrupt and arbitrary paragraphs.', 'In such an\\n\\naccount, the reader is left to infer from these expressive silences the author’s intent.', 'While this\\n\\nanalysis adheres to a feminist interpretation of the text, the results appear to validate that\\n\\nperspective, given the author was committed to a platform of activism defending women’s rights\\n\\nand underwent a similar experience of isolation.', 'In Gilman’s story, the narrative gaps, inexplicable silences, and\\n\\nomissions of text are literary devices to create spaces in the text where readers are invited to\\n\\nparticipate in fashioning alternative endings by filling in what has not been written or by\\n\\nimagining what could have happened.']\n"
