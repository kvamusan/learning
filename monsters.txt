monsters
foreign Music
to the bogeyman from the dragons of Legion to the Creature from the Black

Lagoon monsters have haunted the human imagination going bump in our night
its almost as though we needed monsters those metaphors for death as aphrodisiacs for life to unite us in our
common struggle against the implacable Fates its strange to see how monsters change
with the Fashions Carl Sagan speculates that the Mythic Dragon Commodore so many
cultures may be a race memory of the giant reptiles the dinosaurs Tyrannosaurus Rex
certainly the monsters in Japans postwar movies The Great Godzillas who are awakened from ancient Slumbers by
nuclear tests whereupon they Trump all over Tokyo a Ali Echoes are the
nightmares of Hiroshima and nagasani in medieval times the holy mother Church
confronted a timid peasantry The Apparition of the devil while the
skeleton with the scythe and hourglass reminded man how human life was harvested in reoccurring plagues
and what better image of a parasitic aristocracy than the bloodsucking Count
Dracula foreign times as we began to wonder just where medicine and science might be taking us
we saw the birth of Dr Frankensteins monster of Jekyll and Hyde
technological anxieties gave us the Relentless robot while Cold War fears
filled our skies with flying sources and Intergalactic gasolines that impervious to our weapons could only be destroyed
by a combination of prayer and the common cold now make the most venerable monster in
the English language from the most enduring AngloSaxon myth Grendel that
featured player in our nightmare since the th Century Grendel whose story has been told and retold in every era
Grendel ancient monster child of a more monstrous mother who would emerge from his cave to terrorize the little kingdom
of Good King rothka devouring his subjects and killing his Bravest Warriors
until his majesty called in the help of the Mighty Hero Beowulf Beowulf who would fulfill a prophecy by
cutting off the monsters arm and leaving him to die beneath the stars
our version of Grendel is seen through th century eyes when perhaps were a little suspicious of the military hero
and more inclined to see Humanity in a monster for Grendel ancient Grendel who has
watched Human Society developing growing more complex as it invented things like politics religion and art in is
deserving of our sympathy and our thanks for without our monsters our
misunderstood monsters who are after all only doing their job which is to stimulate our imaginations and encourage
social cohesion we wouldnt be in the Civilized mess we are today
ladies and gentlemen it is with pride that we introduce the lonely lovable monster who has been living and dying
for  Centuries with our very best interests at heart

each other I would listen to their noise secretly watch their battles I began to

be more amused and frightened by them it didnt matter to me what they did to each other

sometimes a Hut was burned any survivors would crawl off to a neighbor and beg to

be taken in theyd hand over whatever they had left any cows and pigs any of the things they

used to prod or hit each other any pretty things or shiny things and in

return theyd be allowed to sleep in the Cow Shed and eat the worst of the food

some four dispossessed persons that arrived today I havent got the horns on it its not a hero was that its a

kings at number two they give it to me its a tribute real gold It is Well its not many

Spears though or swords the kings growing wealth attracted

enemies yes theyd come in the night thundering

up on Horseback leaping the pig fences scattering the livestockers the doors banged open and the Kings Warriors

tumbled out of their Mead Halls then theyd stop and face each other waving

their products and shouting their lungs out terrible threats things about their

fathers and those their fathers fathers and even about their mothers things

about Justice and honor then they would fight the king and his growing band won

every time and took more tributes within a Dozen Years there was nobody left strong enough to challenge them

spiritual come on then lets get on it

depression strand

what was all that then the great bogey here we cut him about a bit no reckon he

will be back it was on God in it whose fault is it

great book I mean bloody hell wheres your Devotion to your king oh perhaps

the fault is a lack of Devotion to the king of the Gods your new priest perhaps

your frivolous appointment has made the king and the gods a bit

upset with us he is not the only one what are you doing about on first but

speech in there about sons and ears Im your successor remember

that was that was just for the last one you think this visit from the great

Boogie is a sign that were in trouble with the king of the godsend I believe Im approximately right I know something

of such matters I have studied the runes I can instruct your new priest in the

morning we will appease the king of the Gods

God have pity I yield that a hundred times that night hammering the ground in

the middle of the forest where I had fled slamming the ground so hard that a seam

split open  feet long why hadnt they been able to understand that we could all live together

Music in the morning I sat on a neighboring

Hill dabbing mud into my various cuts and wounds and watched them perform a

funny ritual for the Warriors Id been obliged to kill they threw up a tangled terrible nest of

sticks that wouldnt do justice to a feebleminded crow then tossed the bodies onto it oh the Dreadful waste of

food the shape are harmed and hard a bit and then as if in response to some

signal lit the bonfire red flame turned on blackening flesh

reaching up into Greeces smoke that swallowed the sky then According to some

lunatic Theory they threw on Golden Rings old swords serviceable helmets and

chanted heroic catch cries as if theyd run some great battle

I laughed at myself had I really been all that anxious to be accepted by them

Midnight foolishness oh

I went home to my ugly loving mother

Music that night in the safety of my cave I

had a dream or perhaps adjourned

ah Grendel youve come weve been expecting you stand around the side boy I get a cop

sometimes and um hmm Applause

well speak up boy and say hello there Mr

Dragon and now you now have they felt when they saw you eh scared enough to be in their

pants you didnt did you good thats valuable stuff youre standing on

Music

you you have a point about how they must feel when they see me I mean its one

thing to eat one of them from time to time it keeps their numbers down for one thing but its quite another to give

them heart attacks for no fit Up Sticks pardon why not frighten them

stupid stupid stupid the whole kitten caboodle why did you come here why bother me

dont tell me I know I know everything thats what makes me so sick and old and

tired Im sorry I know youre sorry I

know everything youre sorry right now for this one frail flicker flash in the

long dull fall to Eternity Im not impressed Im sorry dont keep saying

that I know everything you see the beginning the present the end everything

you now now you know the past and the patent like other low creatures no higher

faculties than memory and perception but we dragons my boy have a whole different kind of mind we see how it will be not

that we cause things to happen you understand no no weed dragons dont mess with your piddling free will no we dont

cause things anyone who argues otherwise is is Grendel dont look so bored think how I

must feel I I know youre sorry I know I

know everything about you I know why you were invented in the

first place do you know why ah

theyre half right with their mumbo jumbo theyve stumbled onto a half truth

good and evil positive and negative theres a fundamental involved here Grendel for everything thats cold

theres something hot for everything that is theres something else thats not light must have its Darkness good

must have its bad for everything subtracted theres something else to add

for everyone whos rich another turn up pool for everyone who never was theres

one who was before for every positive and negative is knocking at the door

in the eye ignorances Bliss in short dear Grendel you are here you exist

simply to go bumps in their night thats silly

silly did you hear what the boy said the dragon is silly silly silly silly the

shaper illusion tripe mere Slayton wits you are the reality you will drive them

to poetry science religion in their efforts to explain you you want me to

scare them to its not what I want youll do it anyway arent you making me

oh I bloody hell

are your name

are you right with your God or devil for I am about to send you to him

for Christmas Music

why didnt you stop him well I couldnt resist it really there

they were smugly damning all their enemies to hell I simply did what the

dragon said I should said I would and gave them something to worry about

mind you I wish Id taken his helmet off first I think Ive broken a tooth

that was the start of this silly business this uh War they call it thats

been going on for a dozen years now to stop them becoming too smug Id drop in

from time to time and eat one or two why who knows why I hated the greedy little

King now becoming dottier by the uh doting on two really beastly children

that the queen had borne him I despised unfath the Great Hero who clearly loved

the queen hated the king and continued to issue pompous challenges mostly to me

without ever being willing to act I teased him by ignoring him and killing

others who raised their swords to me with far less Fury I envied the shape of his poetry but

despised his Mystic meddling it seemed to me that as the dragon would

have it I was following some natural law by giving them a challenge far above their Petty domestic squabbles shaking

them up a bit during this one frail flicker flashing along dull Paul to

Eternity end quote but I couldnt be sure even

now as I made my way for the umpteenth time to their Mead Hall yeah

am Grendel a record of mead Halls ruiner of

words whose literal meaning is the opposite of what is actually meant oh an entertaining monster an asset at a

ball youre almost quoted rightly with a tendency tomorrow though a tendency

tomorrow Music hes too clever for his own good dad

shaper a gentlemanly monster perhaps a trifle tall removal of a foot or two May
